I have considered two possible options for this requirement:

1:Make call to NPS service by making call out from apex which is being invoked from flow.
2:Make call to NPS Service from a batchable apex class condidering batch size of 30.


Limitations-Possible problems:

1:Considering NPS service can accept 30 order ids in one request(Approach 2 should be used),in this case, Flow should be bulkified also callout limit(100) and heap size issues should be handled .
2:Error handling within flow should be considered.
